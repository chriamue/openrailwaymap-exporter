//! Module `railway_algorithms` provides algorithms for working with railway networks.
//!
//! The module contains the `PathFinding` trait, which offers methods to calculate the
//! shortest path distance, the shortest path as a list of node IDs, and the shortest
//! path as a list of edge IDs for railway networks.

/// The `PathFinding` trait is implemented for the `RailwayGraph` type, allowing users
/// to perform pathfinding operations on railway graphs.
