# Introduction

Welcome to the OpenRailwayMap Exporter documentation! This Rust-based tool retrieves railway data from OpenRailwayMap using the Overpass API and exports it into a custom format. It offers a command-line interface, web app, 3D visualization, Python bindings, and more.

In this documentation, you'll learn how to install and use OpenRailwayMap Exporter, as well as how to integrate it with other tools and platforms. We will cover topics such as installation, usage, command-line options, web app, 3D visualization, Python bindings, Jupyter Notebook, profiling, benchmarking, and contributing to the project.

Let's get started!
